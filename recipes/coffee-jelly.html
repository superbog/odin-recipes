        <h2>Description : </h2>
        <p>This coffee jelly is a refreshing Japanese summertime treat made with coffee, powdered gelatin, and sugar. My favorite way to serve it is with frozen whipped cream and chocolate sauce, although it's also delicious with ice cream, regular whipped cream, or flavored coffee cream. It can be served solid in glasses or cubed in bowls.</p>

            <li>2 cups fresh brewed coffee</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
